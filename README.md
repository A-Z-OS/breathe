# **Breathe: AQI Prediction Tool**

**Breathe** is a data science project that uses historical air quality data to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for the next day. This project fetches AQI data for a specified city from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes the data, and trains a machine learning model to predict the AQI for tomorrow. The results are displayed through a plot showing past AQI values along with the predicted AQI for tomorrow.

## **Features**

- Fetches AQI data from OpenWeatherMap API.
- Processes the data to make it suitable for machine learning predictions.
- Uses linear regression to predict the AQI for the next day.
- Displays a graph with the actual AQI data and the predicted AQI for tomorrow.
- Adds a progress bar during model training for better visualization of the process.

## **Installation**

To run **Breathe**, youâ€™ll need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/A-Z-OS/breathe.git
cd breathe
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
Make sure you have **Python 3** installed. Then, install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should include:

```
requests
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tqdm
scipy
```

### 3. Get your OpenWeatherMap API Key

You need an API key to fetch AQI data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

1. Sign up for an account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
2. Get your API key by following their instructions.
3. Replace `'XXXX'` in the code with your actual API key:

```python
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## **Usage**

1. **Fetch Historical Data**:  
   The program fetches the historical AQI data for the last 90 days for a specified city.

2. **Train the Model**:  
   The data is used to train a simple linear regression model to predict the AQI for the next day.

3. **Plot the Results**:  
   The results, including past AQI values and the predicted AQI for tomorrow, are displayed on a graph.

### To Run the Program:
Simply run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Output:
- A graph will be displayed showing the historical AQI for the past 90 days and the predicted AQI for tomorrow.
- The predicted AQI for tomorrow will be shown next to a red dot on the graph.
- The model's Mean Squared Error (MSE) will be printed to the console.

### Notes:
- Ensure you have a valid API key from OpenWeatherMap for the program to work.
- The graph generated by the program will show the AQI values for the past 90 days and the predicted AQI for tomorrow.
- The model is trained using a linear regression approach, which may not be the most accurate for this type of prediction. Feel free to improve the model by using more sophisticated techniques!
